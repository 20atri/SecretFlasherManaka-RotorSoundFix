Mod Name: Rotor Sound Fix
Description:
In the game SecretFlasherManaka, it seems that only the vibrator has vibration sound effects. So, I made a DLL mod to give the rotors sound. The purpose of this mod is to allow the rotors to have sound effects when used individually.
Usage:
Install the BepInEx framework.
Place the downloaded .dll file into the folder path: 秘密のエクスポーズ v1.1.1\BepInEx\plugins.
Compatibility:
I have tested this on game versions v1.1.1 and v1.1.3. Other versions have not been tested yet.
